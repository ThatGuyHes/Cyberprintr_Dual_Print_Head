# *old* Cyberprintr_Dual_Print_Head

This system was inspired by Stratasys 3d printers that lift and cool down the nozzle when switching between Tool 0 and Tool 1.
Custom machined parts may not be obtainable for everyone so feel free to mod the heck out of this design. [Don't forget to share ;)]

You will also need to **install your own bowden extruders**. I recommend the Mobius M4 from Voron. Also a wipe and purge bucket will improve oozing issues if you add one.

**This design is very experimental! No firmware included!**

Also I'm sorry the CAD is quite messy.
